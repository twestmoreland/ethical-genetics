				<h1>Ethics of Genetic Manipulation</h1>
				<p>Transgenic biotechnology presents an exciting range of possibilities, from feeding the hungry to preventing and treating diseases; however, these promises are not without potential peril. Some of the issues that need to be considered are the following:</p>
			</section>
		</header>
		
		<section>
			<h2>Social Concerns</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>If the blending of animal and human DNA results, intentionally or not, in chimeric entities possessing degrees of intelligence or sentience never before seen in nonhuman animals, should these entities be given rights and special protections?</li>
				<li>What, if any, social and legal controls or reviews should be placed on such research?</li>
				<li>What unintended personal, social, and cultural consequences could result?</li>
				<li>Who will have access to these technologies and how will scarce resources such as medical advances and novel treatments be allocated?</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Extinsic Concerns</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>What, if any, health risks are associated with transgenics and genetically modified foods?</li>
				<li>Are there long-term effects on the environment when transgenic or genetically modified organized are released in the field?</li>
				<li>Should research be limited and, if so, how should the limits be decided? How should the limits be enforced nationally and internationally?</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Intrinsic Concerns</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Are there fundamental issues with creating new species?</li>
				<li>Are species boundaries &ldquo;hard&rdquo; or should they be viewed as a continuum? What, if any, consequences are there of blurring species boundaries?</li>
				<li>Are chimeras and transgenics more likely to suffer than &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; organisms?</li>
				<li>Will transgenic interventions in humans create physical or behavioral traits that may or may not be readily distinguished from what is usually perceived to be human?</li>
				<li>What, if any, research in genetic engineering should be considered morally impermissible and banned (e.g., research undertaken for purely offensive military purposes)?</li>
				<li>Will these interventions redefine what it means to be normal?</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

			<h2>Trading DNA Between Species</h2>
			<p>Some individuals argue that crossing species boundaries is unnatural, immoral, and in violation of God&rsquo;s laws, which presumes that species boundaries are fixed and readily delineated. However, several books and journal articles demonstrate that the concept of fixed species boundaries continues to be a hotly debated topic. Some bioethicists point out that a variety of species concepts exist: biological, morphological, ecological, typological, evolutionary, and phylogenetic, to name a few. All of these definitions of what a species is reflect both changing theories and the varying purposes for which individuals conceptualize and utilize different species. If species boundaries are simply a matter of a naming convention, and there are no truly fixed boundaries to cross, then many philosophical objections to transgenics are rendered less problematic.</p>
			<p>While the morality of crossing species boundaries reflects differing worldviews and is subject to disagreement there are, however, several known risks associated with the transplantation of cells or organs from animals to humans. For example, there is a small but significant risk of the transmission of usually fatal zoonotic diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (aka &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;), porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and Nipah encephalitis. The introduction of these diseases to the human population could have devastating consequences. As a result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned xenotransplantation trials using nonhuman primates until the procedures have been adequately demonstrated to be safe and until ethical issues have been sufficiently publicly discussed. However, with the advent of stem cell tissue engineering and 3-D printing, xenotransplantation may quickly become outmoded, opening the doors to more complex social, ethical, and legal issues and discourses.</p>
			<p>In addition to the issue of species boundaries, there are other issues that need to be considered and discussed prior to large-scale acceptance and usage of transgenics and other genetic engineering research, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the risks and benefits of the experimental use of animals;</li>
				<li>the risk of creating new diseases for which there is no treatment by combining animal DNA or human DNA with plant DNA;</li>
				<li>the potential long-term risks to the environment;</li>
				<li>the potential for increased suffering of transgenic organisms. Various bioethicists, environmentalists, and animal rights activists have argued that it is wrong to create animals that would suffer as a result of genetic alteration (for example, a pig with no legs) and that such experimentation should be banned.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Legal Implications of Transginetics</h2>
			<p>Several bioethicists have called for a ban on species-altering technologies that would be enforced by an international tribunal. Part of the rationale for this ban is the concern that such technologies could be used to create a slave race that is, a race of subhumans that could be exploited. In April 1998, scientists Jeremy Rifkin and Stuart Newman, who are both opposed to genetically modified organisms (GMOs), applied for a patent for a &ldquo;humanzee&rdquo; (part human and part chimpanzee) to intentionally fuel debate on the issues and draw attention to potential abuses. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) denied the patent on the grounds that it violated the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which explicitly prohibits slavery.</p>
			<p>Although the USPTO has permitted the extensive patenting of bioengineered life forms, the question that was raised by Newman and Rifkin&rsquo;s application is one that will not easily be resolved: What constitutes a person? A genetic definition is not very helpful, given the variability of gene sequences between individuals. A species definition can be controversial, as mentioned earlier. If we look to specific characteristics for a definition, we are faced with the fact that humans share many characteristics with primates and other animals so where do we draw the line?</p>
			<p>If we create a being that has the ability to speak and perhaps even reason, but looks like a dog or a chimp, should that creation be given all the rights and protection traditionally bestowed upon a person? Some bioethicists argue that the definition of a human being should be more expansive and protective, rather than more restrictive. Others argue that more expansive definitions could minimize humanity&rsquo;s status and create a financial disincentive to patenting creations that could be of potential use. The question of whether the definition should be more expansive or restrictive will need to be considered as courts, legislatures, and institutions address laws regarding genetic discrimination.</p>
			<p>In a similar vein, the medical director of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has expressed concern that athletes have started employing genetic engineering to get an edge over their competition. If individuals are willing to genetically manipulate their children to make them better athletes, then it&rsquo;s likely individuals will be willing to manipulate their children to better looking, more musically inclined, or whatever else might give them an advantage. Opponents of genetic manipulation argue that, by allowing this, we run the risk of creating a race of superhumans, changing what it means to be &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and increasing the ever-widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. Proponents of genetic manipulation argue that currently parents can and do give their children advantages by sending them to better schools or giving them growth hormones, and that banning genetic manipulation is a denial of individual liberties. These arguments also reflect the opposing philosophies regarding how scarce resources should be allocated.</p>

			<h2>Experimentation for the Sake of Farm Animals</h2>
			<p>The number of genetically modified? animals used in agriculture has increased significantly in recent years. Researchers have genetically engineered a number of mammals, from laboratory animals to farm animals, as well as birds, fish and insects. The most widely used genetically modified animals are laboratory animals, such as the fruitfly (Drosophila) and mice. Genetically engineered animals enable scientists to gain an insight into basic biological processes and the relationships between mutations and disease.</p>
			<p>However, farm animals, such as sheep, goats and cows, can also be genetically modified to enhance specific characteristics. These can include milk production and disease resistance, as well as improving the nutritional value of the products they are farmed for. For example, cows, goats and sheep have been genetically engineered to express specific proteins in their milk.</p>
			<p>The majority of work on genetically modified farm animals is still in the research phase and is yet to be used commercially. Below are some of the advantages and disadvantages associated with genetically modifying animals for agriculture, divided up into four key areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do the benefits of genetically modified farm animals outweigh the risks?</li>
				<li>Is genetic modification of farm animals ethical?</li>
				<li>Is it morally acceptable to genetically modify farm animals?</li>
				<li>Is there a thorough regulatory process for genetic modification of farm animals?</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Are the Risks Outweighed?</h3>
			<h4>Yes</h4>
			<p>Genetic engineering holds great potential in many fields, including agriculture, medicine and industry.</p>
			<p>Genetic modification can increase the yield from farm animals, for example cows can be engineered to produce more milk for the same size of herd. </p>
			<p>Genetically modified farm animals are being used to produce important medicinal products, such as antibodies, in large quantities. These products can be used for the treatment of many different human conditions. The current production system for such products is donated human blood, which is in limited supply due to a lack of donors. Sheep and goats can be modified to produce medicinal products in their milk. This has no negative impact on the animal but the product can help to treat human diseases.</p>
			<h4>No</h4>
			<p>The transfer of genetic material from one species to another raises potentially serious health issues for animals and humans.</p>
			<p>There is a risk that new diseases from genetically engineered animals could be spread to non-genetically engineered animals, and even humans.</p>
			<p>In many cases, selective breeding is just as effective as genetic engineering and doesn&rsquo;t carry the same risks.</p>
			<p>We don&rsquo;t yet know if eating the products of genetically modified animals could potentially harm us.</p>
			<h3>Is it Ethically Acceptable to Genetically Modify Farm Animals?</h3>
			<h4>Yes</h4>
			<p>Genetic engineering is a logical continuation of selective breeding, which has been done by humans for thousands of years.</p>
			<p>Genetic engineering of animals is strictly controlled by animal cruelty legislations in many countries and is always carefully scrutinised by teams of experts before being approved for wider use.</p>
			<h4>No</h4>
			<p>Many of the embryos that undergo genetic engineering procedures do not survive.</p>
			<p>Genetic modification can put animals at risk of harm. For example, transgenic pigs were found to be arthritic, partially blind and infertile when a human growth hormone was inserted into their genomes to make them grow faster.</p>
			<h3>Morally Acceptable</h3>
			<h4>Yes</h4>
			<p>Not all genetic engineering directly benefits humans. Some genetic engineering is to improve resistance of livestock to disease, for example, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (&lsquo;mad cow disease&rsquo;) in cattle. It can also be used to remove characteristics that cause injury, for example, selecting for cattle without horns.</p>
			<p>Animals have been used to help humans for millennia. Many would say that human lives are of higher moral value than animal lives.</p>
			<p>The percentage of genetically modified farm animals is tiny compared to the number of animals slaughtered for humans to eat. This practice is widely seen as morally acceptable.</p>
			<h4>No</h4>
			<p>Research could use other organisms such as plants and bacteria to mass produce therapies for human medicine. For example, genetically engineered cereal grains to produce human proteins.</p>
			<p>The cost to the animal always outweighs the benefits as, by carrying out genetic engineering, we are violating their rights.</p>
			<p>Genetic engineering often involves modifying animals for reasons that have no benefit for that species, and could potentially cause them pain and discomfort.</p>
			<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be attempting to &lsquo;play God&rsquo;. Life should not be regarded as a product that can be altered and played with for economic benefit.</p>
			<h3>Is there a thorough regulatory process for genetic modification of farm animals?</h3>
			<h4>Yes</h4>
			<p>It has been suggested that, as a rule, genetically engineered animals should be no worse off than the equivalent stock would be if they were not genetically engineered.</p>
			<p>The Animal Welfare Act, a federal law passed in the UK in 1966, requires all entities looking to carry out research with animals to have their programme reviewed before they go ahead, have veterinary care programmes in place and staff that are qualified to care for live animals.</p>
			<p>The UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 has set out guidelines for research involving animals.</p>
			<p>The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in the USA regulates genetic engineering with animals and their products under the new animal drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). It helps monitor and maintain certain standards, including input from the public, when it comes to genetically engineering animals.</p>
			<p>The &lsquo;new animal drug&rsquo; provisions of the FFDCA focuses on whether the new animal drug is safe for the animal and if it is effective. If the drug is for a food-producing animal it also focuses on whether the resulting food is safe to eat.</p>
			<h4>No</h4>
			<p>Genetic engineering of animals is a relatively new practice and is mainly used in research. As a result regulations for its use in farming are minimal.</p>
			<p>For regulations that have been put in place for the use of animals in research, it is often unclear how they would be applied to genetic engineering of farm animals and few guidelines refer to it directly.</p>
