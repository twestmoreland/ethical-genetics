					<h1>Welcome to Ethical Genetics</h1>
					<p>The ethics of genetic engineering is something people have been arguing over for quite some time. Are the animals hurt in the process? Do we, as humans, have the rights to alter an animal&rsquo;s genetics? Is what we are doing simply an extension of natural selection or is it something much, much more? The answer to all these questions is something you must come up with for yourself as everyone has a different opinion. However, we can give you a lot of information to help you figure out your opinion. Nowadays, breakthroughs in molecular biology are happening at an unprecedented rate. One of such breakthough is the ability to engineer transgenic animals, i.e., animals that carry genes from other species. The technology has already produced transgenic animals such as mice, rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, and cows.</p>

				<h2>What are the Ethical Concerns Surrounding Transgenesis?</h2>
				<p>This website focuses on the giving you the information you need to determine your own opinion on the world&rsquo;s newest technology; however, thoughtful ethical decision-making cannot be ignored by the biotechnology industry, scientists, policy-makers, and the public. These ethical issues include questions such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Should there be universal protocols for transgenesis?</li>
					<li>Should such protocols demand that only the most promising research be permitted?</li>
					<li>Is human welfare the only consideration? What about the welfare of other life forms?</li>
					<li>Should scientists focus on in vitro (cultured in a lab) transgenic methods rather than, or before, using live animals to alleviate animal suffering?</li>
					<li>Will transgenic animals radically change the direction of evolution, which may result in drastic consequences for nature and humans alike?</li>
					<li>Should patents be allowed on transgenic animals, which may hamper the free exchange of scientific research?</li>
				</ul>
