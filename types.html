			<h2>How are Transgenic Animals Produced?</h2>
			<p>Since the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953, molecular biology research has gained momentum. Molecular biology technology combines techniques and expertise from biochemistry, genetics, cell biology, developmental biology, and microbiology.</p>
			
			<p>Scientists can now produce transgenic animals because, since Watson and Crick&rsquo;s discovery, there have been breakthroughs in:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>recombinant DNA (artificially-produced DNA)</li>
				<li>genetic cloning</li>
				<li>analysis of gene expression (the process by which a gene gives rise to a protein)</li>
				<li>genomic mapping</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The underlying principle in the production of transgenic animals is the introduction of a foreign gene or genes into an animal (the inserted genes are called transgenes). The foreign genes &ldquo;must be transmitted through the germ line, so that every cell, including germ cells, of the animal contain the same modified genetic material.&rdquo; (Germ cells are cells whose function is to transmit genes to an organism&rsquo;s offspring.)</p>
			<p>To date, there are three basic methods of producing transgenic animals:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>DNA microinjection</li>
				<li>Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer</li>
				<li>Embryonic stem cell-mediated gene transfer</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Gene transfer by microinjection is the predominant method used to produce transgenic farm animals. Since the insertion of DNA results in a random process, transgenic animals are mated to ensure that their offspring acquire the desired transgene. However, the success rate of producing transgenic animals individually by these methods is very low and it may be more efficient to use cloning techniques to increase their numbers. For example, gene transfer studies revealed that only 0.6% of transgenic pigs were born with a desired gene after 7,000 eggs were injected with a specific transgene.</p>

					<h3>DNA Microinjection</h3>
					<p>The mouse was the first animal to undergo successful gene transfer using DNA microinjection.6 This method involves:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>transfer of a desired gene construct (of a single gene or a combination of genes that are recombined and then cloned) from another member of the same species or from a different species into the pronucleus of a reproductive cell</li>
						<li>the manipulated cell, which first must be cultured in vitro (in a lab, not in a live animal) to develop to a specific embryonic phase, is then transferred to the recipient female</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Unlike the other two methods, which require live transgenic offspring to test for the presence of the desired transgene, this method allows testing for transgenes at the cell stage.</p>
					<p>During microinjection, DNA is injected directly into the cell, or even into the cell nucleus via an inserted cannula. The process is observed and controlled under the microscope. The DNA is then integrated into the plant genome &ndash; probably during the cell&rsquo;s own DNA repair processes.</p>
					<p>The advantage of microinjection is that with this method, genetic modification in theory no longer requires a marker gene.</p>
					<p>The target gene, which confers a new trait, is introduced directly into a single cell. The cells transformed in this way are easy to identify if a dye is injected along with the DNA (see photo). If the process works, it will no longer be necessary to select the transformed cells using antibiotic resistance or herbicide resistance markers. So far this method has been used primarily with animal cells. One of the ways in which plant cells differ from animal cells is that they have a stable cell wall. To use microinjection with plants the method has to be adapted to their special characteristics.</p>
					<p>The most important difference is the cell wall and the internal cell pressure of up to 30 bar. If the kind of cannula used for animal cells is used on plant cells it causes a drastic loss of pressure and the cell dies. To solve the problem, even thinner cannula tips are being developed and used in combination with a finely adjustable pressure generator. In this way the cannula enters the plant cell without destroying it. Another approach to improving microinjection as a transformation method for plant cells focuses on the efficiency with which the injected genes are integrated into the plant genome. One way of improving this is to inject special proteins along with the target gene sequences which support the stable integration of &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; genes into the plant genome and are produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens (agroinjection). This soil bacterium is naturally capable of inserting its own genes into the genome of plants.</p>
					<p>Results: Several biosafety research projects have looked at microinjection in plants and it has been successfully established as a new transformation method.</p>
					<p>However, it was not possible in all cases to achieve high transformation efficiency. In addition, it was possible to regenerate transgenic plant cells into plants following microinjection only when a marker gene (kanamycin resistance) had been introduced. For the time being then, even microinjection cannot do without marker genes.</p>
					<p>By contrast, agroinjection is not necessary in order to produce transgenic plants using microinjection. In principle, this opens up the possibility of using this method commercially at a low cost.</p>

					<h3>Retrovirus-Mediated Gene Transfer</h3>
					<p>A retrovirus is a virus that carries its genetic material in the form of RNA rather than DNA. This method involves:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>retroviruses used as vectors to transfer genetic material into the host cell, resulting in a chimera, an organism consisting of tissues or parts of diverse genetic constitution</li>
						<li>chimeras are inbred for as many as 20 generations until homozygous (carrying the desired transgene in every cell) transgenic offspring are born</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Retroviral vectors provide a highly efficient method for gene transfer into eukaryotic cells. This vector system can be divided into two components; the retroviral vector itself, which generally does not encode viral proteins, and the retrovirus packaging cell line, which provides the viral proteins necessary for vector transfer. Improvements in the design of both of these components have led to impressive gene transfer efficiencies, approaching 100% even in primary cells.</p>
					<p>Improvements in retrovirus packaging cells have focused on reduction of the potential of these cell lines to produce replication-competent helper virus while still allowing the production of retroviral vectors at high titer. These goals have been accomplished by making multiple alterations in the replication-competent retrovirus used to make the packaging cells such that viral proteins are still made but viral RNA cannot be packaged into virions, reverse transcribed, or integrated.</p>
					<p>A key improvement in the design of murine virus-based retroviral vectors was the discovery that the signal for packaging of viral RNA into virions extends into the gag region of the virus. Inclusion of this region in vectors provided about a 10-fold increase in vector titer and a corresponding increase in gene transfer efficiency compared with earlier vectors. However, homologous overlap of gag sequences in the retroviral vector and sequences present in packaging cells led to frequent generation of helper virus in early packaging cell lines, and can still lead to infrequent helper virus generation in improved packaging cells line. In addition, these new vectors contained portions of viral coding regions that could lead to the production of proteins which are antigenic or have other unwanted properties.</p>

					<h3>Embryonic Stem Cell-Mediated Gene Transfer</h3>
					<p>This method involves:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>isolation of totipotent stem cells (stem cells that can develop into any type of specialized cell) from embryos</li>
						<li>the desired gene is inserted into these cells</li>
						<li>cells containing the desired DNA are incorporated into the host&rsquo;s embryo, resulting in a chimeric animal</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Unlike the other two methods, which require live transgenic offspring to test for the presence of the desired transgene, this method allows testing for transgenes at the cell stage.</p>
					<p>Currently, mouse fibroblasts unlimited line (STO) or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast, namely MEF) was widely used to prepare the feeder layer. These cells can secrete fibroblast growth factor (FGF), differentiation inhibitory factor (DIA), white leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and other substances. They also promote the growth and colonization of ES cells and suppress their differentiation. The STO or MEF is treated with mitomycin vitamin C or other mitotic inhibitor, early embryos or PGCs is cultured on the feeder layer and ES cells can be obtained. Rat liver cell conditioned medium (buffalo liver conditioned medium) is another wildly used differentiation inhibiting medium. In addition, sheep oviduct epithelial (oTE), goat oviduct epithelial (cTE), sheep uterine epithelium (oUE), goat uterine epithelium (cUE), bovine granulosa cells (bG), bovine uterine fibroblasts (bUF) and fetal bovine testes, kidney and liver fibroblasts (fbTF, fbKF, fbLF), etc., are also used as feeder layers in laboratories.</p>
					<p>Several conditions must be met for isolating ES cells. 1) Present cells in culture must be undifferentiated and pluripotent. 2) The pluripotent cells must be deprived of differentiation signals in culture. 3) The cells must be stimulated, or at least be allowed, to proliferate.</p>
					<h4>Characteristics of ES cells</h4>
					<p>ES cells are small, aggregated and unpolarized cells forming islands on the feeder layers and have large nucleoli and a high nucleo-cytoplasmic rate. Cell markers have been used to characterize undifferentiated or differentiated ES cells. Alkaline phosphatase is equivalent to the cell surface nonspecific alkaline phosphatase of the inner cell mass of the mouse blastocyst. Other markers are surface glycolipids (ECMA-7), embryoglycans (SSEA-1) and so on. As gene expression characteristics of ES cells, they express all the &ldquo;house-keeping&rdquo; genes involved in the machinery of cell cycling and some receptors to factors which allow them escaping cycling and differentiating.</p>
					<h4>ES cells for transgenesis</h4>
					<p>ES cells are highly efficient materials for animal cloning. With the development of chimeric nuclear transfer technology and production technology, ES cells are widely used in animal cloning. Proliferation of ES cells derived from donor as the nucleus, which in chimeric germline, produce following generations by sperm or egg cell proliferation.</p>
					<p>Introduction of foreign DNA by electroporation into ES cells is very efficient. The DNA integrates into genome at a frequency of -10-3, then numerous markers are used for efficient selection. The gene-modified cell clones are introduced back into preimplantation stage embryos, either by blastocyst injection or by morula aggregation, to produce chimeras.</p>
