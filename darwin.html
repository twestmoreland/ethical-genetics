					<h2>Synopsis</h2>
					<p>Charles Darwin, in full Charles Robert Darwin   (born February 12, 1809, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England&mdash;died April 19, 1882, Downe, Kent), English naturalist whose scientific theory of evolution by natural selection became the foundation of modern evolutionary studies. An affable country gentleman, Darwin at first shocked religious Victorian society by suggesting that animals and humans shared a common ancestry. However, his nonreligious biology appealed to the rising class of professional scientists, and by the time of his death evolutionary imagery had spread through all of science, literature, and politics. Darwin, himself an agnostic, was accorded the ultimate British accolade of burial in Westminster Abbey, London.</p>
					<p>Darwin formulated his bold theory in private in 1837&mdash;39, after returning from a voyage around the world aboard HMS Beagle, but it was not until two decades later that he finally gave it full public expression in On the Origin of Species (1859), a book that has deeply influenced modern Western society and thought.</p>

					<h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
					<p>Darwin was the second son of society doctor Robert Waring Darwin and of Susannah Wedgwood, daughter of the Unitarian pottery industrialist Josiah Wedgwood. Darwin&rsquo;s other grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, a freethinking physician and poet fashionable before the French Revolution, was author of Zoonomia; or the Laws of Organic Life (1794&mdash;96). Darwin&rsquo;s mother died when he was eight, and he was cared for by his three elder sisters. The boy stood in awe of his overbearing father, whose astute medical observations taught him much about human psychology. But he hated the rote learning of Classics at the traditional Anglican Shrewsbury School, where he studied between 1818 and 1825. Science was then considered dehumanizing in English public schools, and for dabbling in chemistry Darwin was condemned by his headmaster (and nicknamed &ldquo;Gas&rdquo; by his schoolmates).</p>
					<p>His father, considering the 16-year-old a wastrel interested only in game shooting, sent him to study medicine at Edinburgh University in 1825. Later in life, Darwin gave the impression that he had learned little during his two years at Edinburgh. In fact, it was a formative experience. There was no better science education in a British university. He was taught to understand the chemistry of cooling rocks on the primitive Earth and how to classify plants by the modern &ldquo;natural system.&rdquo; At the Edinburgh Museum he was taught to stuff birds by John Edmonstone, a freed South American slave, and to identify the rock strata and colonial flora and fauna.</p>

					<p>More crucially, the university&rsquo;s radical students exposed the teenager to the latest Continental sciences. Edinburgh attracted English Dissenters who were barred from graduating at the Anglican universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and at student societies Darwin heard freethinkers deny the Divine design of human facial anatomy and argue that animals shared all the human mental faculties. One talk, on the mind as the product of a material brain, was officially censored, for such materialism was considered subversive in the conservative decades after the French Revolution. Darwin was witnessing the social penalties of holding deviant views. As he collectedsea slugs and sea pens on nearby shores, he was accompanied by Robert Edmond Grant, a radical evolutionist and disciple of the French biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. An expert on sponges, Grant became Darwin&rsquo;s mentor, teaching him about the growth and relationships of primitive marine invertebrates, which Grant believed held the key to unlocking the mysteries surrounding the origin of more-complex creatures. Darwin, encouraged to tackle the larger questions of life through a study of invertebrate zoology, made his own observations on the larval sea mat (Flustra) and announced his findings at the student societies.</p>
					<p>The young Darwin learned much in Edinburgh&rsquo;s rich intellectual environment, but not medicine: he loathed anatomy, and (pre-chloroform) surgery sickened him. His freethinking father, shrewdly realizing that the church was a better calling for an aimless naturalist, switched him to Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, in 1828. In a complete change of environment, Darwin was now educated as an Anglican gentleman. He took his horse, indulged his drinking, shooting, and beetle-collecting passions with other squires&rsquo; sons, and managed 10th place in the Bachelor of Arts degree in 1831. Here he was shown the conservative side of botany by a young professor, the Reverend John Stevens Henslow, while that doyen of Providential design in the animal world, the Reverend Adam Sedgwick, took Darwin to Wales in 1831 on a geologic field trip.</p>
					<p>Fired by Alexander von Humboldt&rsquo;s account of the South American jungles in hisPersonal Narrative of Travels, Darwin jumped at Henslow&rsquo;s suggestion of a voyage toTierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of South America, aboard a rebuilt brig, HMSBeagle. Darwin would not sail as a lowly surgeon-naturalist but as a self-financed gentleman companion to the 26-year-old captain, Robert Fitzroy, an aristocrat who feared the loneliness of command. Fitzroy&rsquo;s was to be an imperial-evangelical voyage: he planned to survey coastal Patagonia to facilitate British trade and return three &ldquo;savages&rdquo; previously brought to England from Tierra del Fuego and Christianized. Darwin equipped himself with weapons, books (Fitzroy gave him the first volume of Principles of Geology, by Charles Lyell), and advice on preserving carcasses from London Zoo&rsquo;s experts. The Beagle sailed from England on December 27, 1831.</p>

					<h2>The Beagle Voyage</h2>
					<p>The circumnavigation of the globe would be the making of the 22-year-old Darwin. Five years of physical hardship and mental rigour, imprisoned within a ship&rsquo;s walls, offset by wide-open opportunities in the Brazilian jungles and the Andes Mountains, were to give Darwin a new seriousness. As a gentleman naturalist, he could leave the ship for extended periods, pursuing his own interests. As a result, he spent only 18 months of the voyage aboard the ship.</p>
					<div class="blockquote green column thirteen append-2">
						<p>The hardship was immediate: a tormenting seasickness. And so was his questioning: on calm days Darwin&rsquo;s plankton-filled townet left him wondering why beautiful creatures teemed in the ocean&rsquo;s vastness, where no human could appreciate them.</p>

					<p>The hardship was immediate: a tormenting seasickness. And so was his questioning: on calm days Darwin&rsquo;s plankton-filled townet left him wondering why beautiful creatures teemed in the ocean&rsquo;s vastness, where no human could appreciate them. On the Cape Verde Islands (January 1832), the sailor saw bands of oyster shells running through local rocks, suggesting that Lyell was right in his geologic speculations and that the land was rising in places, falling in others. At Bahia (now Salvador), Brazil, the luxuriance of the rainforest left Darwin&rsquo;s mind in &ldquo;a chaos of delight.&rdquo; But that mind, with its Wedgwood-abolitionist characteristics, was revolted by the local slavery. For Darwin, so often alone, the tropical forests seemed to compensate for human evils: months were spent in Rio de Janeiro amid that shimmering tropical splendour, full of &ldquo;gaily-coloured&rdquo; flatworms, and the collector himself became &ldquo;red-hot with Spiders.&rdquo; But nature had its own evils, and Darwin always remembered with a shudder the parasitic ichneumon wasp, which stored caterpillars to be eaten alive by its grubs. He would later consider that evidence against the beneficent design of nature.</p>
					<p>On the River Plate (R&iacute;o de la Plata) in July 1832, he found Montevideo, Uruguay, in a state of rebellion and joined armed sailors to retake the rebel-held fort. AtBah&iacute;a Blanca, Argentina, gauchos told him of their extermination of the Pampas &ldquo;Indians.&rdquo; Beneath the veneer of human civility, genocide seemed the rule on the frontier, a conclusion reinforced by Darwin&rsquo;s meeting with General Juan Manuel de Rosas and his &ldquo;villainous Banditti-like army,&rdquo; in charge of eradicating the natives. For a sensitive young man, fresh from Christ&rsquo;s College, that was disturbing. His contact with &ldquo;untamed&rdquo; humans on Tierra del Fuego in December 1832 unsettled him more. How great, wrote Darwin, the &ldquo;difference between savage &amp; civilized man is. It is greater than between a wild &amp; [a] domesticated animal.&rdquo; God had evidently created humans in a vast cultural range, and yet, judging by the Christianized savages aboard, even the &ldquo;lowest&rdquo; races were capable of improvement. Darwin was tantalized, and always he niggled for explanations.</p>
					<p>His fossil discoveries raised more questions. Darwin&rsquo;s periodic trips over two years to the cliffs at Bah&iacute;a Blanca and farther south at Port St. Julian yielded huge bones of extinct mammals. Darwin manhandled skulls, femurs, and armour plates back to the ship&ndash;relics, he assumed, of rhinoceroses, mastodons, cow-sized armadillos, and giant ground sloths (such as Megatherium). He unearthed a horse&ndash;sized mammal with a long face like an anteater&rsquo;s, and he returned from a 340-mile (550-km) ride to Mercedes near the Uruguay River with a skull 28 inches (71 cm) long strapped to his horse. Fossil extraction became a romance for Darwin. It pushed him into thinking of the primeval world and what had caused those giant beasts to die out.</p>

						<p>The land was evidently changing, rising; Darwin&rsquo;s observations in the Andes Mountains confirmed it.</p>
					</div>
					<p>The land was evidently changing, rising; Darwin&rsquo;s observations in the Andes Mountains confirmed it. After the Beagle surveyed the Falkland Islands, and after Darwin had packed away at Port Desire (Puerto Deseado), Argentina, the partially gnawed bones of a new species of small rhea, the ship sailed up the west coast of South America to Valpara&iacute;so, Chile. Here Darwin climbed 4,000 feet (1,200 metres) into the Andean foothills and marveled at the forces that could raise such mountains. The forces themselves became tangible when he saw volcanic Mount Osorno erupt on January 15, 1835. Then in Valdivia, Chile, on February 20, as he lay on a forest floor, the ground shook: the violence of the earthquake and ensuing tidal wave was enough to destroy the great city of Concepci&oacute;n, whose rubble Darwin walked through. But what intrigued him was the seemingly insignificant: the local musselbeds, all dead, were now lying above high tide. The land had risen: Lyell, taking the uniformitarian position, had argued that geologic formations were the result of steady cumulative forces of the sort we see today. And Darwin had seen them. The continent was thrusting itself up, a few feet at a time. He imagined the eons it had taken to raise the fossilized trees in sandstone (once seashore mud) to 7,000 feet (2,100 metres), where he found them. Darwin began thinking in terms of deep time.</p>
					<p>They left Peru on the circumnavigation home in September 1835. First Darwin landed on the &ldquo;frying hot&rdquo; Galapagos Islands. Those were volcanic prison islands, crawling with marine iguanas and giant tortoises. (Darwin and the crew brought small tortoises aboard as pets, to join their coatis from Peru.) Contrary to legend, those islands never provided Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;eureka&rdquo; moment. Although he noted that the mockingbirds differed on four islands and tagged his specimens accordingly, he failed to label his other birds&mdash;what he thought were wrens, &ldquo;gross-beaks,&rdquo; finches, and oriole-relatives&mdash;by island. Nor did Darwin collect tortoise specimens, even though local prisoners believed that each island had its distinct race.</p>
					<p>The &ldquo;home-sick heroes&rdquo; returned via Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia. By April 1836, when the Beagle made the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean&mdash;Fitzroy&rsquo;s brief being to see if coral reefs sat on mountain tops&mdash;Darwin already had his theory of reef formation. He imagined (correctly) that those reefs grew on sinking mountain rims. The delicate coral built up, compensating for the drowning land, so as to remain within optimal heat and lighting conditions. At the Cape of Good Hope, Darwin talked with the astronomer Sir John Herschel, possibly about Lyell&rsquo;s gradual geologic evolution and perhaps about how it entailed a new problem, the &ldquo;mystery of mysteries,&rdquo; the simultaneous change of fossil life.</p>
					<p>On the last leg of the voyage Darwin finished his 770-page diary, wrapped up 1,750 pages of notes, drew up 12 catalogs of his 5,436 skins, bones, and carcasses&mdash;and still he wondered: Was each Galapagos mockingbird a naturally produced variety? Why did ground sloths become extinct? He sailed home with problems enough to last him a lifetime. When he landed in October 1836, the vicarage had faded, the gun had given way to the notebook, and the supreme theorizer&mdash;who would always move from small causes to big outcomes&mdash;had the courage to look beyond the conventions of his own Victorian culture for new answers.</p>

					<h2>Evolution by Natural Selection: the London years, 1836&mdash;42</h2>
					<p>With his voyage over and with a &pound;400 annual allowance from his father, Darwin now settled down among the urban gentry as a gentleman geologist. He befriended Lyell, and he discussed the rising Chilean coastline as a new fellow of the Geological Society in January 1837 (he was secretary of the society by 1838). Darwin became well known through his diary&rsquo;s publication as Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the Various Countries Visited by H.M.S. Beagle (1839). With a &pound;1,000 Treasury grant, obtained through the Cambridge network, he employed the best experts and published their descriptions of his specimens in his Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle (1838&mdash;43). Darwin&rsquo;s star had risen, and he was now lionized in London.</p>
					<p>It was in those years of civil unrest following the First Reform Act (1832) that Darwin devised his theory of evolution. Radical nonconformists were denouncing the church&rsquo;s monopoly on power&mdash;attacking an Anglican status quo that rested on miraculous props: the supposed supernatural creation of life and society. Darwin had Unitarian roots, and his breathless notes show how his radical Dissenting understanding of equality and antislavery framed his image of mankind&rsquo;s place in nature: &ldquo;Animals&mdash;whom we have made our slaves we do not like to consider our equals.&mdash;Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind?&rdquo; Some radicals questioned whether each animal was uniquely &ldquo;designed&rdquo; by God when all vertebrates shared a similar structural plan. The polymathic Charles Babbage&mdash;of calculating machine fame&mdash;made God a divine programmer, preordaining life by means of natural law rather than ad hoc miracle. It was the ultra-Whig way, and in 1837 Darwin, an impeccable Whig reformer who enjoyed Babbage&rsquo;s soirees, likewise accepted that &ldquo;the Creator creates by...laws.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>The experts&rsquo; findings sent Darwin to more-heretical depths. At the Royal College of Surgeons, the eminent anatomist Richard Owen found that Darwin&rsquo;s Uruguay River skull belonged to Toxodon, a hippopotamus-sized antecedent of the South American capybara. The Pampas fossils were nothing like rhinoceroses and mastodons; they were huge extinct armadillos, anteaters, and sloths, which suggested that South American mammals had been replaced by their own kind according to some unknown &ldquo;law of succession.&rdquo; At the Zoological Society, ornithologist John Gould announced that the Galapagos birds were not a mixture of wrens, finches, and &ldquo;gross-beaks&rdquo; but were all ground finches, differently adapted. When Gould diagnosed the Galapagos mockingbirds as three species, unique to different islands, in March 1837, Darwin examined Fitzroy&rsquo;s collection to discover that each island had its representative finch as well. But how had they all diverged from mainland colonists? By that time Darwin was living near his freethinking brother, Erasmus, in London&rsquo;s West End, and their dissident dining circle, which included the Unitarian Harriet Martineau, provided the perfect milieu for Darwin&rsquo;s ruminations. Darwin adopted &ldquo;transmutation&rdquo; (evolution, as it is now called), perhaps because of his familiarity with it through the work of his grandfather and Robert Grant. Nonetheless, it was abominated by the Cambridge clerics as a bestial, if not blasphemous, heresy that would corrupt mankind and destroy the spiritual safeguards of the social order. Thus began Darwin&rsquo;s double life, which would last for two decades.</p>
					<p>For two years he filled notebooks with jottings. There was an intensity and doggedness to it. He searched for the causes of extinction, accepted life as a branching tree (not a series of escalators, the old idea), tackled island isolation, and wondered whether variations appeared gradually or at a stroke. He dismissed a Lamarckian force driving life inexorably upward with the cavalier joke, &ldquo;If all men were dead then monkeys make men.&mdash;Men make angels,&rdquo; which showed how little the failed ordinand shared his Cambridge mentors&rsquo; hysteria about an ape ancestry. Indeed, there was no &ldquo;upward&rdquo;: he became relativistic, sensing that life was spreading outward into niches, not standing on a ladder. There was no way of ranking humans and bees, no yardstick of &ldquo;highness&rdquo;: man was no longer the crown of creation.</p>
					<p>Heart palpitations and stomach problems were affecting him by September 1837. Stress sent him to the Highlands of Scotland in 1838, where he diverted himself studying the &ldquo;parallel roads&rdquo; of Glen Roy, so like the raised beaches in Chile. But the sickness returned as he continued chipping at the scientific bedrock of a cleric-dominated society. The &ldquo;whole [miraculous] fabric totters &amp; falls,&rdquo; he jotted. Darwin had a right to be worried. Were his secret discovered, he would stand accused of social abandon. At Edinburgh he had seen censorship; other materialists were being publicly disgraced. His notes began mooting disarming ploys: &ldquo;Mention persecution of early astronomers.&rdquo; Behind his respectable facade at the Geological Society lay a new contempt for the divines&rsquo; providential shortsightedness. The president, the Reverend William Whewell, &ldquo;says length of days adapted to duration of sleep of man.!!!&rdquo; he jotted. What &ldquo;arrogance!!&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Mankind: there was the crux. Darwin wrote humans and society into the evolutionary equation from the start. He saw the social instincts of troop animals developing into morality and studied the humanlike behavior of orangutans at the zoo. With avant-garde society radicalized, Darwin moved into his own ultra radical phase in 1838&mdash;even suggesting that belief in God was an ingrained tribal survival strategy: &ldquo;love of [the] deity [is an] effect of [the brain&rsquo;s] organization. Oh you Materialist!&rdquo; he mocked himself. In a day when a gentleman&rsquo;s character had to be above reproach, Darwin&rsquo;s notes had a furtive ring. None of that could become known&mdash;yet. The rich careerist&mdash;admitted to the prestigious Athenaeum Club in 1838 and the Royal Society in 1839&mdash;had too much to lose.</p>
					<p>As a sporting gent from the shires, Darwin queried breeders about the way they changed domestic dogs and fancy pigeons by spotting slight variations and accentuating them through breeding. But he only saw the complete congruity between the way nature operated and the way fanciers produced new breeds upon reading the economist Thomas Malthus&rsquo;s Essay on the Principle of Population in September 1838. That was a seminal moment&mdash;even if Malthusian ideas had long permeated his Whig circle. Darwin was living through a workhouse revolution. Malthus had said that there would always be too many mouths to feed&mdash;population increases geometrically, whereas food production rises arithmetically&mdash;and that charity was useless. So the Whigs had passed a Malthusian Poor Law in 1834 and were incarcerating sick paupers in workhouses (separating men from women to stop them from breeding). Darwin&rsquo;s dining companion Harriet Martineau (whom many expected to marry his brother, Erasmus), was the Whigs&rsquo; poor law propagandist. (Her novelistic Malthusian pamphlets had been sent to Darwin while he was on the Beagle.) Darwin realized that population explosions would lead to a struggle for resources and that the ensuing competition would weed out the unfit. It was an idea he now applied to nature (he had previously thought that animal populations remained stable in the wild). Darwin called his modified Malthusian mechanism &ldquo;natural selection.&rdquo; Nature was equally uncharitable, went the argument: overpopulated, it experienced a fierce struggle, and from all manner of chance variations, good and bad, the best, &ldquo;the surviving one of ten thousand trials,&rdquo; won out, endured, and thus passed on its improved trait. That was the way a species kept pace with the Lyellian evolution of Earth. </p>
					<p>Darwin was a born list maker. In 1838 he even totted up the pros and cons of taking a wife&mdash;and married his cousin Emma Wedgwood (1808&mdash;96) in 1839. He rashly confided his thoughts on evolution, evidently shocking her. By now, Darwin accepted the notion that even mental traits and instincts were randomly varying, that they were the stuff for selection. But he saw from Emma&rsquo;s reaction that he must publicly camouflage his views. Although the randomness and destructiveness of his evolutionary system&mdash;with thousands dying so that the &ldquo;fittest&rdquo; might survive&mdash;left little room for a personally operating benign deity, Darwin still believed that God was the ultimate lawgiver of the universe. In 1839 he shut his last major evolution notebook, his theory largely complete.</p>
