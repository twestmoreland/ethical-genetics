				<h1>About Ethical Genetics</h1>
				<p>The purpose of our organization is to present information about genetically engineered animals in a clear and easy to understand manner. We want to provide you with what you need to know to make your own decision about whether or not it is ethical to genetically modify animals. Reports given by scientists on what they are doing is difficult for non-biologists to understand, so we&rsquo;re here to help. We will occasionally point out our opinion on the matter for each type of biotechnology, however, we will also encourage readers to form their own opinion of the material. If you have an opinion on an article or would like to share your opinions on the matter, let us know in the blog section. Questions about the material will also be able to be submitted to the author of the webpage. Feel free to ask anything and we&rsquo;ll try to answer it!</p>
